is the process of tracking and managing changes to documents or code over time.

## differences between **Git** and **Github** :

 Git is a free, open source version control tool that developers install locally on their personal computers, while GitHub is a pay-for-use online service built to run Git in the cloud.

 ## 3 other github alternatives :

 - Gitlab
 - Bitbucket
 - GitKraken

git rebase [-i | --interactive] [ options ] [--exec cmd] [--onto newbase | --keep-base] [upstream [branch]].

## terms git cherry-pick and the command for it :
